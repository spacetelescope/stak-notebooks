    "The traditional IRAF workflow consists of individual tasks that take a FITS file as input, run a data processing algorithm on the input file, and return an updated output file for the user.  The workflow in Python is very different.  Like most interpreted languages, data manipulation is more a flow of operations expressed in regular code than individual tasks that operate on files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of providing an input FITS file to a task and getting an updated output file, for many astronomy Python functions the user will open the FITS file themselves, access the file object, and continue with any analysis or data processing from there.  Once the data manipulation is done (which could be a long sequence of manipulations), if the user would like to update their FITS files they actively save the changes to the file.  This could include saving out intermediate steps to new files, if the user so desires. While this may take a few more lines of code to open and close files, you gain the major advantage of flexibility, customization and freedom, as well as potentially more efficient I/O.  Often times the increase in the number of lines of code allows the user to be more explicit about what the code is doing, instead of relying on complex parameter files and black box code.  If a user finds themselves running the same code numerous time and would find a one line call useful, they can always put their workflow into a function in a Python file and it will be ready to import and use in any local Python session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly useful for this kind of scientific workflow is the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This tool allows users to run fully interactive Python sessions with the ability to save the code that was run, it's screen output, the order it was run in, and other helpful tools.  If you are new to Python, we highly recommend taking advantage of this tool.  All STAK notebooks were written in Jupyter Notebooks.  This means the user can downloads these notebooks and run all code examples locally, adding additional code to use their data in the provided examples. For a more in-depth example of how to effectively use Python and the Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, there are some good video tutorials by [Jake VanderPlas here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/)."

    "Utilities to open, edit, and save FITS files are contained in the [Astropy package](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/). Although there are many documentation resources for this package (which we will reference below in the [links and resources section](#links)), it can be a bit overwhelming for new users. To help new users adjust to a more Pythonic workflow, some of the examples shown in the STAK notebooks do not show the opening and closing of the FITS file.  Instead, we show the basic calls to do this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we show any code, we will go over a basic explanation of the Astropy classes and object types for FITS files. The highest level class for a FITS file is the [HDUList](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/api/hdulists.html).  This is the object type you get when you first open a FITS file in Astropy.  The HDUList contains a sequence of HDU (Header Data Unit) objects. There are three common flavors of HDU object, a [PrimaryHDU](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/api/hdus.html#), an [ImageHDU](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/api/images.html#astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU) and a [BinTableHDU](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/api/tables.html#astropy.io.fits.BinTableHDU).  As you would expect, the PrimaryHDU object contains the primary header, the ImageHDU object contains an image array and it's associated header, and a BinTableHDU object contains a binary table and it's associated header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level of objects are the individual header and data objects.  Headers are stored in a [Header](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/api/headers.html) object.  Images are stored in a [Numpy array](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) object. Binary tables are stored in a [record array](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/usage/table.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the object types, we will show with code snippets how to extract and work with these objects using a FITS file containing image data. For more information on table data see the [Astropy FITS Table tutorial](http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/FITS-tables.html). For more detailed coverage of the avaialbe tools in the Astropy FITS module see the [narrative documentation page](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/)."
