Notebooks for STAK project
==========================
This repository houses the STAK Jupyter notebooks. Readthedocs page can be found here: http://stak-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Useful Resources
================
Usage of the Jupyter notebooks requires some prior knowledge of Jupyter and Astropy FITS I/O.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks here is a beginner's guide: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

If you are new to working with FITS files in Python we highly recommend working through the examples in the Astropy FITS I/O documentation: http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/.

Contributing
============
Please open a new `issue <https://github.com/spacetelescope/-notebooks/issues>`_
or new `pull request <https://github.com/spacetelescope/stak-notebooks/pulls>`_
for bugs, feedback, or new features you would like to see.

If there is an issue you would like to work on, please open an issue and
we will be happy to assist. New contributions and contributors are very welcome! For
some comprehensive guidlines to contributing on Github, Astropy has a very nice
write up here: http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html.
But please keep in mind not all repositories on Github will want this contribution workflow.
If you need some help applying the Astropy contribution guide to this project, we are available for
questions/guidance.
